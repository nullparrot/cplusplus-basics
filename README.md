# Overview

To learn and practice C++, I've made this repository to work on 2023 Advent of Code problems. THe puzzles provide interesting questions and challenges to solve.

I'll also collect snippets of code here that will be useful for future projects.

# Development Environment

I worked with C++ in Visual Studio Code on Windows. To be able to run my code more simply I install MSYS2. This allowed me to easily compile my code by pressing the run button in my code editor.
